            The Crisis: Why Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) is Essential for
            Chronic Care Management

            The escalating chronic disease crisis affects nearly 75% of American
            adults, driving up healthcare costs, provider burnout, and care
            gaps. Effective, HIPAA-compliant Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)
            streamlines chronic care management, simplifies RPM CPT codes, and
            maximizes Medicare reimbursement for proactive, profitable medicine.
